# javascript-calculator
This webpage was an Assignment made for my Beginning Web Programming Course I took during my Associate's at ACC. For this assignment, I used HTML, CSS, and 
JavaScript to create a fully functional math calculator that can handle a wide variety of operations and equations. The calculator operates using a variety of 
functions and event handlers. Users can input numbers and symbols using the on-screen keypad or their own keyboard. It is on a fictional site called "Math Table" 
which provides math resources for children. Since the calculator was the main focus of the assignment, the other links are for display only and don't go anywhere.
